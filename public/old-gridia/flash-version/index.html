This is an old version of Gridia! Entirely in actionscript 3. After realizing the original code was pretty bad, I decided to start from scratch and came up with this.

<span id="root"></span>

<script>
  function getUrlVars() {
      var vars = {};
      var parts = window.location.href.replace(/[?&]+([^=&]+)=([^&]*)/gi, function(m,key,value) {
          vars[key] = value;
      });
      return vars;
  }

  function onLoad()
  {
    var val = parseInt(getUrlVars()['build']);
    console.log(val);
    if (isNaN(val)) val = 8;
    var width = 608;
    var height = 544;
    if (val == 1) {
      width = 640;
      height = 480;
    }
    instruct = "";
    switch(val){
      case 1: instruct = "Click to toggle land/water."; break;
